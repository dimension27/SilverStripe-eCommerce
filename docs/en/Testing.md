Testing the eCommerce Module
============================
Testing is highly important for maintaining a quality product.

Regression Testing
------------------
[Google doc containing regression tests](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AtHUrSaBxJY8dG8teWVNTFYzbThZYUhhLTNmT0FiUHc&hl=en)

Unit Testing
------------
We insist that the eCommerce module contains a suite of unit tests that are updated with any changes to the code. Sub-Modules should also have their own test suites.
See the [sapphire testing documentation](http://doc.silverstripe.org/sapphire/en/topics/testing/index) for setup information etc.

TBA: At some stage an automated testing system will continually test the code, especially when new commits are made.

To run all ecommerce tests:

dev/tests/CheckoutPageTest,EcommerceTest,OrderItemTest,OrderModifierTest,OrderTest,PaymentTest,ProductBulkLoaderTest,ProductOrderItemTest,ProductTest,ShoppingCartTest

#### Tests that have/will be written
